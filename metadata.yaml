description: 'The Covered Wagon tells the epic story of a wagon train on the Oregon
  Trail. First published in 1922, this historical novel offers something for everyone:
  action, intrigue, humor, and a classic love triangle. It is based on actual first-handed
  accounts of the grueling four-month overland journey, featuring cameos by famous
  frontiersmen Kit carson and Jim Bridger. Both the novel and its film adaptation
  helped to make the wagon train an unforgettable icon of the Old West.'
